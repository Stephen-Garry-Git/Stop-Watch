# Stop-Watch

# ⏱️ Day 11 - Stop Watch App

This is a simple yet stylish **Stop Watch web app** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can start, pause, and reset time — with smooth updates every millisecond. This project is part of my **30 Days of JavaScript Challenge**.

## 🧪 How It Works

- When the Start button is clicked:
  - It records the current time using `new Date().getTime()`.
  - A `setInterval()` updates the time every 10ms.
- When you Stop:
  - It saves the total time passed (so it can resume).
- Reset:
  - Clears everything and resets the display.
